			<p>Discover why Glacier National Park’s nickname is the Crown of the Continent. First, spend a day in Whitefish. Have a nice dinner at the Tupelo Grille. Before heading into Glacier National Park, grab a coffee at Montana Coffee Traders. Start your Glacier experience on the Going-to-the-Sun Road, the only road that goes through the heart of the park. On your drive, keep an eye out for wildlife, especially mountain goats. Finish your drive at St. Mary Lake, where you can take a sunset cruise of the lake. After spending a night on the east side of the park, drive down Highway 2 for views of the south edge of the park.</p>
