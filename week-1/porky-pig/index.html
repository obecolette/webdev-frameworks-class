					<h2>Those who teach, learn.</h2>
					<p>At Porky Pig, we take pride in our work teaching others and sharing
					what we’ve learned. Whether by speaking at a conference, leading a
					class, or writing on this very blog, we’ve taught or shared our
					knowledge on best practices for web design and devlopment, user
					experience design, business advice, and even the occasional informal
					primer on animated GIFs. 
					 
					When someone at Porky Pig tells me that they’re teaching a class
					for a website or a local university, or a workshop at a conference,
					my first response to them is one of encouragement.

					Then, I say: The best way to get better at what you do is to 
					teach others how to do it, too.</p>

				<h2>About</h2>
				
				<div class="col-3">
					<h5>We’ve been designing digital 
					experiences ever since the web 
					existed. And that entire time 
					we’ve stayed ahead of the curve.</h4>

					<p>An inspirational leader in the digital
					design industry, Elmer Fudd, 
					crowned the “King of Wascally
					Wabbits” by Looney Tunes and the 
					first inductee to the SXSW Interactive 
					Festival Hall of Fame, founded Porky Pig
					in 1999. Porky Pig has grown to 
					become an industry-leading, diverse
					group of problem-solving superstars
					across three studios, united under 
					the common goal of making the web
					a better place to think, work and play.</p>	
				</div>	

				<div class="col-3">
					<p>At Porky Pig, we openly share 
					knowledge rather than tuck it away for some secret strategic advantage. An 
					industry that shares information makes a better industry. We seek every 
					opportunity to write, teach, and speak about what we do, and that's a big reason why our clients come to us.

					As Porky Pig continues to evolve, we'll always be looking for ways to make 
					digital communication, and the business that surrounds it, as meaningful and 
					enjoyable as it can be.</p>
